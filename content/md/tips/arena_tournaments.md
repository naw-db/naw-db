* **<span style="color:red">IF YOUR GAME FREEZES DURING A TOURNAMENT AND YOU ARE EITHER AHEAD OR TIED IN SCORE, DO NOT FORCE CLOSE THE APP! WAIT 5 MINUTES FOR THE GAME CLOCK TO EXPIRE, THE GAME WILL END, AND YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A LOSS.</span>**
* For round robin tournaments, enter your players in order that you use your best player in the last match. If you require 3 players for 3 games, your best player should be in position 3, second best in position 2, 3rd in position 1.
* You score more points for winning a game without conceding a basket to your opponent, which subsequently enables you to finish higher on the tournament leaderboard to earn better rewards when the tournament ends.
* Be sure to enter all tournaments you are eligible to enter that offer tournament rings as a reward, as these are the biggest time gate in the game and can only be collected by winning Arena Tournaments (other than from referral rewards).
* It is recommended to use the maximum amount of boosts to you players when participating in a tournament as well as gear that provides the greatest increase to your stats and when your warm up boost is fully applied.
* There are a few other attributes to the Leaderboard placements along with points scored per match. Like Ball Handling, reaction time, and the time taken to make shots or the opportunity for the opponent to Dunk or Drive freely. These can contribute players to reaching higher positions.
