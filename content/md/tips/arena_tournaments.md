* **IF YOUR GAME FREEZES DURING A TOURNAMENT AND YOU ARE EITHER AHEAD OR TIED IN SCORE, DO NOT FORCE CLOSE THE APP! WAIT 5 MINUTES FOR THE GAME CLOCK TO EXPIRE, THE GAME WILL END, AND YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A LOSS.**
* For round robin tournaments, enter your players in order that you use your best player in the last match. If you require 3 players for 3 games, your best player should be in position 3, second best in position 2, 3rd in position 1.
* You score more points for winning a game without conceding a basket to your opponent, which subsequently enables you to finish higher on the tournament leaderboard to earn better rewards when the tournament ends.
* Be sure to enter all tournaments you are eligible to enter that offer tournament rings as a reward, as these are the biggest time gate in the game and can only be collected by winning Arena Tournaments (other than from referral rewards).
