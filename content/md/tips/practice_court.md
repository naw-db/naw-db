* Use the Practice mode to practice your steals and blocks on defense, and how to most effectively score on offense, using the players you will be using in tournaments.
* Try playing 1v1 against players in your roster with higher skills than your active player to practice being outmatched to learn how to win in these situations.
* You can earn XP from your first 3 wins in practice each day, the reset occurs at midnight local time.
* It is best to play against an All-World tier player in practice to maximise the XP you earn in the first 3 wins each day.
