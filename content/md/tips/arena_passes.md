* It is not worth **paying** for the All-Access pass, Eastern Conference pass, or Western Conference pass. If you need a pass to enter a tournament, it is cheaper to just buy the pass for that arena for 100 cash.
* Similarly, it is not worth paying for additional storage for these "special" passes
* It is not worth **buying** an arena pass for a tournament that does not offer tournament rings as a reward, (unless you specifically want the rewards on offer)
