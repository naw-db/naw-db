* If your energy drops below 10, your player will be severely hampered in his attempts to shoot, move and defend, be sure to refuel before your energy gets this low.
* You can access the energize screen by clicking on the energy bar in the player management screen, instead of the manage roll up banner. This avoids accidentally clicking on the release button.
