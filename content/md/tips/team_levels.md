* It does not pay to hold off leveling up early in the game, the amount of cred, XP and Team Rep increases for each drill/1v1 game you play each time you increase your team level, and the daily tournament rewards get better too.
* Pay attention to the tasks requirements for a few team levels in advance to prepare yourself to level up quickly, Tournament rings will become the limiting resource eventually so focus on the players you wish to rank up and get them to level 10 in advance of having the rings required.
* Make sure you have space in your inventory when you level up so that you can receive the rewards from leveling up.
