* The quickest way to reach level 20 is to rank up 6 Starters to Rank 4, plus another 1 Starter to Rank 3, 3 All-Stars to Rank 5 and 1 All-World player to Rank 6. This will cost 345 Tournament rings in total. Check out [this table](#level-up-team-level-fast) for a detailed breakdown.
* Purchasing roster space is not necessary, rather release low skill Starters to keep roster space until you reach level 19-20, when you will unlock full roster space for all players without the need to have purchased any extra.
* If a player is released from an NBA team, he will stop appearing on the map, so pay attention to NBA rosters and if a player is released, ensure you have him on your roster!
* A player can only be ranked up once he is at Level 10 for that rank, you have enough cred as indicated, and you have met the requirements listed in the rank up screen, the rank up banner will turn green and allow you to click on it to rank up the player.
