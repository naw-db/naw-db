* The quickest way to reach level 20 is to rank up 6 Starters to Rank 4, plus another 1 Starter to Rank 3, 3 All-Stars to Rank 5 and 1 All-World player to Rank 6. This will cost 345 Tournament rings in total. Check out [this table](#level-up-team-level-fast) for a detailed breakdown.
* Choose players from different teams, positions and divisions to rank up so you have coverage for tournaments that limit who is eligible based on these three criteria.
* Purchasing roster space is not necessary, rather release low skill Starters to keep roster space until you reach level 19-20, when you will unlock full roster space for all players without the need to have purchased any extra.
* If a player is released from an NBA team, he will stop appearing on the map, so pay attention to NBA rosters and if a player is released, ensure you have him on your roster!
* A player can only be ranked up once he is at Level 10 for that rank, you have enough cred as indicated, and you have met the requirements listed in the rank up screen, the rank up banner will turn green and allow you to click on it to rank up the player.
* High Offense stats will enable you to score more effectively, however based on your gameplay, low offense stats can be overcome with good timing and reactions. Perimeter shooting stat is the key stat for shooting drills against players who spawn on the map.
* High Fitness stats can also be useful to not get pushed around and keep your balance to complement your defense stats, whilst helping to create more space on offense as you move around.
* High Defense stats give you a better chance of successfully stealing/blocking and staying in position, ranking players with high defense stats will enable you to finish higher in tournaments and earn more rings.
* Players will always have the same stats when you recruit them, and always start at their base rank and level: Starters R1L1 (Rank 1, Level 1), All-Stars R2L1, All-World R3L1.
* When at Level 10 (L10), you can gain XP only up to the amount required to level up from L9 to L10 (displayed in the player upgrade section). This can be useful to quickly gain levels after you rank up that player to the next rank.
* The requirement to beat a certain player in drills in order to rank up a player is not specific to that player. That means you can beat the listed player in drills using any player and have it count towards that requirement. It is a total since you started playing.
