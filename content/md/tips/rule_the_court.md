* The best bang for buck is to win 6 games on as many courts as possible.
* From experience of those who have done the extensive research to level up a court, the current rewards for a higher level court are not worth the effort relative the the amount of wins required to earn the maximum rewards at Court Level 1.
* Playing rule the court is important in the early stages of the game to earn as much cash to increase your bag space from the shop.
* Make sure you have plenty of bag space before closing down on Saturday nights so that you can receive all of the rewards from Rule the Court on Sunday morning. Roughly 20 bag space per ruler is recommended.
