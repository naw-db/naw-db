* The best bang for buck is to win 6 games on as many courts as possible.
* From experience of those who have done the extensive research to level up a court, the current rewards for a higher level court are not worth the effort relative the the amount of wins required to earn the maximum rewards at Court Level 1.
* Playing rule the court is important in the early stages of the game to earn as much cash to increase your bag space from the shop.
* Make sure you have plenty of bag space before closing down on Saturday nights so that you can receive all of the rewards from Rule the Court on Sunday morning. Roughly 20 bag space per ruler is recommended.
* You do not have to stay within range of the court to continue playing games at that court, no distance limit has been observed so far. You just have to click on the court while in range and you can continue to play games until you choose to exit the court.
* If you leave your player in the court, he will be automatically returned on Sunday morning and you will earn double the rewards for being there at the end of the week.
* Leaderboards are automatically filled by Bots at the start of each new week, and will be replaced by actual players when they enter the court, you can challenge any player on the leaderboard from any position to knock them off the leaderboard, however you only ever move up 1 position at a time and always enter the leaderboard at the lowest position.
* If a player challenges your player on a court and loses, you will receive the Cred that player risked as a reward.
