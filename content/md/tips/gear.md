* When collecting gear items from drop zones or otherwise, each one is referred to as a "shard", collecting multiple shards allows you to rank up your gear.
* Visit as many T-shirt and Sneaker Drop Zones as possible to rank up your gear to get better boosts for your players.
* Gear can be equipped to as many players as you like after you collect it once, there is no limit once you have that item of gear.
* Branded Gear (Adidas/Puma etc.) is restricted for players who are sponsored by another brand in real life. E.G. A player sponsored by Adidas can wear any Adidas gear but not Puma gear. If a Player is sponsored by Nike, they cannot wear Adidas or Puma gear.
* Headwear, Eyewear, Socks and Basketballs are cosmetic only and do not provide any stat boost to your player. These can be used as a way to categorize players by equipping certain items to them, or purely for drip.
